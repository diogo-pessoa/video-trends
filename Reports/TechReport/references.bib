    abstract = {Bike-sharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities, providing a convenient transportation mode for citizens' commutes. As the rents/returns of bikes at different stations in different periods are unbalanced, the bikes in a system need to be rebalanced frequently. Real-time monitoring cannot tackle this problem well as it takes too much time to reallocate the bikes after an imbalance has occurred. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical prediction model to predict the number of bikes that will be rent from/returned to each station cluster in a future period so that reallocation can be executed in advance. We first propose a bipartite clustering algorithm to cluster bike stations into groups, formulating a two-level hierarchy of stations. The total number of bikes that will be rent in a city is predicted by a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT). Then a multi-similarity-based inference model is proposed to predict the rent proportion across clusters and the inter-cluster transition, based on which the number of bikes rent from/ returned to each cluster can be easily inferred. We evaluate our model on two bike-sharing systems in New York City (NYC) and Washington D.C. (D.C.) respectively, confirming our model's advantage beyond baseline approaches (0.03 reduction of error rate), especially for anomalous periods (0.18/0.23 reduction of error rate).},

    ABSTRACT = {Bike-sharing services are flourishing in Smart Cities worldwide. They provide a low-cost and environment-friendly transportation alternative and help reduce traffic congestion. However, these new services are still under development, and several challenges need to be solved. A major problem is the management of rebalancing trucks in order to ensure that bikes and stalls in the docking stations are always available when needed, despite the fluctuations in the service demand. In this work, we propose a dynamic rebalancing strategy that exploits historical data to predict the network conditions and promptly act in case of necessity. We use Birth-Death Processes to model the stations’ occupancy and decide when to redistribute bikes, and graph theory to select the rebalancing path and the stations involved. We validate the proposed framework on the data provided by New York City’s bike-sharing system. The numerical simulations show that a dynamic strategy able to adapt to the fluctuating nature of the network outperforms rebalancing schemes based on a static schedule.},
